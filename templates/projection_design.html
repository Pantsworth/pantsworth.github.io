                        manipulated in real-time and live-mixed for the show.

                        <h2>American Idiot (Fall 2015)</h2>
                        Collaborated on the video design of several elements of Northwestern University Theater Department's
                        mainstage production
                        of Green Day's American Idiot. I helped shoot, edited, and color three video sequences for the
                        show â€“ a big box store commercial, a faux tourism video, and an introductory sequence for the
                        character Favorite Son.

                        </h2>
                        We turned the back wall of a motel room set into a giant screen, which was used for transitions that
                        illustrated each character's
                        mental state. 5K short-throw Mitsubishi projector. Cued in Resolume Arena. Visuals created in
                        collaboration with Jack Foster and Alex Waldman.

                        <h2>Bug (Fall 2013)
                        </h2>
                        2 TVs powered by Resolume Arena. One TV represented a motel room window, while the other appears as
                        a painting over a motel
                        room bed. The major visual components were animated backdrops for the window, (which grew more
                        unsettling as the production progressed), pre-recorded video cues for different parts of the
                        show, and a processed live-video stream from a camera on set for the end of the show.

                        </h2>
                        Six cast-off standard-definition televisions were wired into the set to create a junkheap look.
                        Televisions were operated
                        via Resolume Arena, and visuals were live-mixed, making use of both original visual designs and
                        60s-era footage. My first projection/visual design!
