    <p class='centered-title notes'><b>Michael's Notes:</b><br>Use a sturdy cast-iron skillet for cooking these, and a second skillet of similar size for doing the smashing (I think it's easier than using a spatula).<br>I like to substitue a 1.5x1.5 (or 2x2) grid of toasted Hawaiian rolls for the hamburger bun.<br></p>

            <div id="steps" class="steps">
            <br>
            1.
            Prepare burger bun by laying toppings on bottom half of bun. Have it nearby and ready for when your burger is cooked.<br><br>

            2.
            Preheat a large stainless steel saut√© pan or skillet over high heat for 2 minutes. Place balls of beef in pan and smash down with a stiff metal spatula, using a second spatula to add pressure. Smashed patties should be slightly wider than burger bun.<br><br>

            3.
            Season generously with salt and pepper and allow to cook until patties are well browned and tops are beginning to turn pale pink/gray in spots, about 45 seconds. Using a bench scraper or the back side of a stiff metal spatula, carefully scrape patties from pan, making sure to get all of the browned bits.<br><br>

            4.
            Flip patties and immediately place a slice of cheese over 1 patty, then stack the second directly on top. Immediately remove from pan and transfer to waiting burger bun. Serve.<br><br>

            5.
            If cooking more than one, heat a large skillet until warm, then turn off the heat. Place finished patties into large skillet and cover. Repeat above process until all burgers are ready to serve. Another option: put an egg on it. <br><br>

            6.
            To cook eggs for your burgers: once you've finished the burger process, turn off the heat on your skillet and quickly crack eggs into the pan. As the whites start to set, pour a glass of water into the pan (careful of the steam!) and cover with a large lid to give the eggs a steam finish.<br><br>
