            <br>
            2 cups all-purpose flour<br>
            2 tablespoons fine-ground cornmeal (optional)<br>
            1 teaspoon salt<br>
            1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br>
            2 large eggs, separated<br>
            4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted<br>
            1.75 cups buttermilk<br>
            Pinch cream of tartar<br><br>

            <div id="steps" class="steps">
            <br>
            1. Heat waffle iron according to the manufacturer’s instructions.<br><br>
            
            2. Meanwhile, whisk together flour, cornmeal (if using), salt, and baking soda in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, butter, and then the buttermilk. Beat the egg whites and cream of tartar with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form, about 2 minutes.<br><br> 

            3. Make  well in the center of the dry ingredients, pour the buttermilk mixture into the well, and whisk very gently until the buttermilk mixture is just incorporated (a few lumps should remain).<br><br>

            4. Toward the end of the mixing, fold the whipped egg whites into the batter.<br><br>
            
            5. Following the manufacturer’s instructions, spread the appropriate amount of batter onto the waffle iron and cook until golden brown, about 3 ½ minutes. Repeat with remaining batter, serving the waffles immediately or holding them in a 200-degree oven until all are cooked.<br><br>
