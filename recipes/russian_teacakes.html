            <br>
            16 tablespoons (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened<br>
            1/2 cup granulated sugar<br>
            1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 
            1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
            2 cups all-purpose flour<br>
            3/4 cups pecans, toasted and chopped fine<br>

            <br>
            1. Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower middle positions and heat oven to 400 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. With electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat butter, sugar, vanilla, and salt until very light and fluffy, 3 minutes. Reduce speed to low, add flour, and mix until just combined. Add pecans and mix until evenly distributed. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour, or up to 2 days.<br><br>

            2. Roll dough into 1-inch balls and place 1 ½ inches apart on prepared baking sheets. Bake until edges are light golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Cool 5 minutes.<br><br>

            3. Sift confectioners’ sugar into medium bowl. Working with 4 to 5 warm cookies at a time, gently toss each in sugar to coat. Transfer cookies to wire rack and cool to room temperature. Toss cooled cookies once more in remaining sugar to coat.<br><br>
